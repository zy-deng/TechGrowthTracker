# TechGrowthTracker

## Introduction
Welcome to my personal learning project, designed to track and motivate my journey through Rust, Python, C++, and database technologies. Here, I record learning materials, set daily goals, reflect on what I've studied, and plan my next steps.

## Objectives
- **Consistent Learning**: Ensure daily progress in Rust, Python, C++, and database technologies.
- **Reflection**: Analyze what I've learned each day to reinforce understanding and identify areas for improvement.
- **Goal Setting**: Define clear, achievable goals for each day and strive to meet them.
- **Motivation**: Keep myself motivated by documenting progress and planning advanced topics to explore.

## Learning Materials
Here I will list all the resources I use to learn each technology:
- **Rust**:
